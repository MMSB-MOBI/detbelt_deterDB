You also need two python packages, csv and datetime if they are not installed enter

> pip3 install csv

> pip3 install datetime

> pip3 install sys

Note: if you don't have pip3 on your computer, try ```sudo apt-get install python3-pip``` first.

When everything is ok place yourself in the program directory with ```cd```
> cd mongodet/bin/csv_to_json directory

then 
> python3 conv.py -i [path_of_file_to_convert] -o [path_of_result_file]

For example you can do ```python3 conv.py -i ./test/data.csv``` 
Note that you can use -i or --input and -o or --output.

Notes
-----

Note that the csv file was obtain by converting the file Base-donnees-detergents-VZ-20171004.xlsx placed in the test directory. It was converted thanks to LibreOfficeCalc using Unicode(UTF-8) using ";" as field separator and " as text separator.

Note also that due to a mistake in the file, the line with Ol√©ate was deleted before using the converter. Empty columns in the table were also deleted, these columns not being able to be detected
